My personal config files for the tools I use all the time. I spent a lot of 
time researching some of them, others not so much. Every once in a while I get 
the itch to dig into some of them (usually vim) and try out new things. Maybe 
some of this will be useful to somebody else too. I know I've learned a lot 
from reading config files that other people have posted, so here's hoping.
